Icon/Vector split: `@mapples/ui`'s `Icon` now renders font glyphs from the `@react-native-vector-icons` families (declared as peer dependencies), resolving its default family from the project style config; the old uri-based SVG icon lives on as the new `Vector` component. `@mapples/style` adds a project-wide `icons` config to the theme, and `@mapples/render` remaps legacy uri `Icon` nodes to `Vector` on document load.
